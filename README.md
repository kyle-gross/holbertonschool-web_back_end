JavaScript ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ECMAScript 6) is the newer version of JavaScript that was introduced in 2015.
  
[EMCAScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources) is the standard that JavaScript programming language uses. ECMAScript provides the specification on how JavaScript programming language should work.  
  
A list of all of the changes from the ES6 update can be found [here](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/), but for this project we will only focus on the following learning objectives.
